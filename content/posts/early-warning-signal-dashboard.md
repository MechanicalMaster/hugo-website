## Project Overview
As a Product Manager at a fintech company, I led the development of an Early Warning Signal (EWS) Dashboard that revolutionized how we manage dealer-anchor relationships and credit risk. The project is live at [Vercel App](https://early-warning-signal.vercel.app) and the code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/MechanicalMaster/early-warning-signal).

## The Challenge
In the supply chain financing industry, managing dealer credit limits and identifying potential defaults early is crucial. Our team needed a solution that would:
- Provide real-time monitoring of dealer credit utilization
- Automate the stop supply process with proper escalations
- Standardize FLDG (First Loss Default Guarantee) invocation rules
- Create a centralized system for dealer and anchor management

## Key Features and Solutions

### Master Module Management
We implemented a comprehensive master module that allows:
- Centralized management of dealers and anchors
- Real-time status tracking (Active/Inactive)
- Credit limit management with utilization tracking
- Detailed audit trails of all status changes

### Stop Supply Automation
One of the most innovative features is the automated stop supply process:
- Configurable rules based on credit utilization and payment patterns
- Multi-level escalation workflow
- Automated email notifications with customizable templates
- Real-time tracking of stop supply cases

### FLDG Rules Engine
We developed a sophisticated rules engine for FLDG management:
- Amount-based rule configuration
- Automated FLDG invocation based on predefined criteria
- Clear visibility of FLDG coverage and exposure
- Standardized process for FLDG claims

### Monitoring and Reporting
The dashboard provides comprehensive monitoring capabilities:
- Standard reports for credit utilization and risk assessment
- Scheduled report generation and distribution
- Program review tracking
- Anchor expiry monitoring

## Product Development Approach

### Rapid Prototyping
We adopted a rapid prototyping approach using Next.js and Shadcn UI components, which proved invaluable:
- Created a fully functional UI prototype in weeks instead of months
- Enabled stakeholder feedback early in the development cycle
- Allowed business users to experience the workflow before actual implementation
- Reduced development iterations and rework

### User-Centric Design
The design process focused heavily on user needs:
- Clean, intuitive interface for complex operations
- Role-based access control
- Customizable views and reports
- Mobile-responsive design for on-the-go access

## Impact and Results
The EWS Dashboard has significantly improved our operations:
- 60% reduction in time spent on credit monitoring
- Standardized stop supply process across all regions
- Improved FLDG invocation success rate
- Better visibility of credit risk across the portfolio

## Technical Implementation
The project leverages modern web technologies:
- Next.js 14 for the frontend framework
- Shadcn UI for consistent design components
- Vercel for seamless deployment
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for responsive styling

## Lessons Learned
1. Early prototyping saves significant development time
2. User feedback during the prototype phase is invaluable
3. Standardizing processes through automation improves efficiency
4. Clear visibility of data helps in better decision-making

## Future Roadmap
We continue to enhance the platform with:
- Advanced analytics and predictive modeling
- Integration with core banking systems
- Mobile app development
- Enhanced reporting capabilities

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how modern web technologies and rapid prototyping can be used to solve complex business problems efficiently. By focusing on user needs and leveraging the right tools, we created a solution that not only meets current requirements but is also scalable for future needs.
